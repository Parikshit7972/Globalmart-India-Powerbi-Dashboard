The company deals in the following product categories:

- **Time Period:** 2022 – 2024  
- **Business Type:** Retail & E-commerce (B2C + B2B)   
- **Data Sources:** Excel / CSV  

## 🎯 Business Problem

Despite having large volumes of sales data, management lacked a **centralized and interactive analytics dashboard** to answer key business questions such as:
- How are sales and profits performing across regions and states?  
- What is the impact of discounts on overall profitability?  
- Which products and customers are truly driving profit?  
- How are sales and profit trending over time?  

Due to the absence of a single source of truth, decisions related to **pricing, promotions, and regional expansion** were largely **assumption-based**.

## 💡 Project Objective
To design and develop an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that enables management to:
- Track overall sales and profit performance  
- Compare regional and state-wise performance  
- Analyze product category and sub-category profitability  
- Evaluate customer segment contribution  
- Understand the relationship between discounts and profit  
- Identify top-performing and loss-making customers  
- Monitor trends, seasonality, and year-over-year growth  

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Sales  
- Total Profit  
- Profit Margin (%)  
- Total Orders  
- Average Discount (%)  
- Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth (%)  
- Best Month by Sales  
- Worst Month by Profit  
- Loss Due to Discount  
- Average Sales per Customer  
- Total Customers
